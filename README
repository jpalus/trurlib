# $Id$ 

TRURL library contains some useful data structures and routines:
- dynamic array 
- linked list 
 (both with Perl-like interface)
- hash table
- some string functions
- n_malloc()s wrappers

and some other n stuff.

There is no docs, but interface is really simple so
reading headers should be enough.  

Library is internally used by poldek project.
